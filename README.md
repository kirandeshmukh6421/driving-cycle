## Generation of Driving Cycle for the Design and Development of an Electric Powertrain for a RWD Tadpole Type 3 Wheeled Personal Mobility Vehicle

Designing an electric powertrain for a Rear-Wheel-Drive (RWD) tadpole-type 3-wheeled personal mobility vehicle involves the development of a driving cycle. A driving cycle is a set of conditions that mimic real-world driving scenarios to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the electric powertrain. For this specific vehicle, the driving cycle should take into account factors like typical urban traffic patterns, acceleration, deceleration, uphill climbs, and cruising speeds. By accurately simulating these conditions, engineers can optimize the powertrain components, such as the motor, battery, and transmission, to ensure the vehicle meets range, performance, and efficiency requirements, while also considering the unique characteristics of a 3-wheeled tadpole design. This approach helps in achieving an electric vehicle that's well-suited for the intended use and maximizes its overall effectiveness.
